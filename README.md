# Brain-Tumor-Classification-and-Image-Segmentation-using-PSO-WOA

This project integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for tumor classification and a hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization-Whale Optimization Algorithm (PSO-WOA) for precise image segmentation. The CNN model, trained on grayscale MRI scans, categorizes tumors into Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, or No Tumor using k-fold cross-validation and data augmentation. For tumor identification, PSO ensures a global search while WOA refines segmentation for accurate boundary detection. This approach enhances automated tumor analysis, aiding radiologists in improved clinical decision-making.
